## Recipe

<Recipe recipe={frontmatter} />

## Note
The coffee has a very berry profile, reminiscent of Kenyan coffees, with a slight pleasant bitterness of tart cranberry, which can be traced from the hot cup, to cooling and is felt on the aftertaste.
As it cools, notes of black tea, spices and lemon zest appear.
