__Cooking: (Direct method)__

First you need to pour in one-third of the total volume of water in relation to the coffee.

That is, __50-60__ ml of water and wait __30__ seconds.

Pour the rest - __120-130__ ml of water and set the piston on top in place, but make a small reverse pulling motion so that water does not flow down through the filter.

Leave the aeropress in this position for another __40__ seconds.

After brewing, you should remove the piston, stir the coffee, put the piston back in and with constant pressure gently lower it for __20-30__ seconds.
