## Recipe

1. Grind 340 g (12 oz) of whole bean coffee on a coarse setting.

2. Add the coffee and 1 oz / 28 g of roasted chicory to the stockpot.

3. Pour 2 qt (2 L) of filtered water into the stockpot. <p class="time-note">Stir with a wooden spoon until the grounds are fully saturated.</p>

4. Cover the stockpot, and steep the coffee and chicory for 12 hours at room temperature.

5. After 12 hours, pour the concentrate through a fine-meshed sieve into the jar.

6. Add simple syrup. <p class="time-note">Add 4 tablespoons / 68 g of simple syrup (made from 3 tablespoons each of sugar and water heated until dissolved) to the coffee concentrate. Stir until syrup is incorporated.

Alternatively: Add just enough simple syrup to each serving to sweeten.</p>

7. Serve over ice. <p class="time-note">Pouring equal amounts of sweetened coffee concentrate and milk or cream (or dairy alternative) into a glass.</p>

## Note

Refrigerate any remaining concentrate. Unsweetened, NOLA lasts 7 days. Sweetened, it’s best consumed within 2 days, and with milk, we recommend drinking up—NOLA’s best when made to order.
